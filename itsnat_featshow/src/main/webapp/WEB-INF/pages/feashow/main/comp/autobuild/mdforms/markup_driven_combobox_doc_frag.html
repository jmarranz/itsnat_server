<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example shows how a client combo box can be
    bound to the server and be controlled by the server markup
    including selection.
    </p>

    <p>User actions are reflected in server markup
    because an <code>ItsNatHTMLSelectComboBox</code> is
    used under the hood in "markup driven" mode.
