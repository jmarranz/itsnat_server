<div class="explanation">
    <p>Normal buttons has not permanent state (selection state exactly),
    the <code>javax.swing.ButtonModel</code> model automatically
    notifies when the button is pressed and released, when a button "click" cycle
    completes an <code>java.awt.event.ActionEvent</code> is fired by the button model,
    a listener to this event is the usual way to "do something when the button is clicked".
    </p>
    <p>By default ItsNat minimizes the client-server communication and sends one DOM "click" event
        to the server when the user "clicks" a button, this event is converted to the pressed-released sequence in one "shot"
        in the button model. This behaviour can be changed to distinguish when the user pressed and released the button as
        two separated events.
    </p>
    <p>All "normal" buttons implement the interface <code>ItsNatButtonNormal</code>
    </p>
