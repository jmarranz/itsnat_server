    <p>Toggle buttons have a permanent state, can be selected/unselected.
    They use <code>javax.swing.JToggleButton.ToggleButtonModel</code> models
    to manage the selection state. This model type notify to registered <code>ItemListener</code>
    objects when the button is selected or unselected as a response of a mouse "click".
    </p>
    <p>There are two toggle button types: check buttons and radio buttons.
    The main difference is radio buttons are grouped and only one radio button can be selected
    per group (if a button is selected the previous selected button is unselected automatically).
    </p>
    <p>All "toggle" buttons implement the interface <code>ItsNatButtonToggle</code>
    </p>
