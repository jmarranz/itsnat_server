<div class="explanation">
    <p>By default any button component listens "click" events, to separate
        the press and release phases we can disable the "click" events calling
        <code>ItsNatComponent.disableEventListener</code> and enable
        "mousedown" and "mouseup" event types calling
        <code>ItsNatComponent.enableEventListener</code> or directly
        adding a listener calling <code>ItsNatComponent.addEventListener</code>,
        the internal button behavior is updated accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>You can enable the "mouseover" and "mouseout" events registering listeners with
        <code>ItsNatComponent.addEventListener</code>.
        When the mouse enters into the button area, a Swing ChangeEvent
        is fired and button "rollover" state is set to true.
        These events are not recommended in ItsNat (server side processing) because of very much events and net traffic,
        use client side code (JavaScript) or CSS instead.
    </p>
    <p>The DOM event "mousemove" can be listened too but the component
        does nothing specific.
