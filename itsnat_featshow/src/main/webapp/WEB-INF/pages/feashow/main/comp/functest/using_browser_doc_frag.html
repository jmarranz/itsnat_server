    <p>Server based functional web testing was introduced before (see "Server-Sent Events"),
        this example shows we can test a small ItsNat web application using components.
    </p>
    <p>Our mini web application tested uses AJAX in asynchronous-hold mode,
        this mode queues sequentially the events but the XMLHttpRequest is used
        in asynchronous mode. When a server fired event call returns there is no
        guarantee that the normal event processing has ended (because the client
        dispatched the event asynchronously). Solutions:
        <ol>
            <li>Set the application in synchronous mode for testing
                (very easy in ItsNat per template or globally).</li>
            <li>Wait until the expected change occurs (for instance
                until the new element is added in the data model, or a new
                DOM element was added).</li>
            <li>Wait a reasonable amount of time.</li>
        </ol>
        This example uses the third approach with asynchronous-hold mode.
    </p>
    <p>SCRIPT Hold mode could used too.</p>
