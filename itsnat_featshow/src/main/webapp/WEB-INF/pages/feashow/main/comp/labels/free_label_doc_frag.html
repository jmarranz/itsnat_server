<div class="explanation">
    <p>Any DOM element can be associated to a label component
        implementing <code>ItsNatFreeLabel</code>. Free labels are
        basically the same as HTML labels.
    </p>
    <p>Again this example shows several component labels, Java values and editors,
    in this case edition is started using a single "click", this event type
    is changed calling <code>ItsNatLabel.setEditorActivatorEvent(String)</code>.
