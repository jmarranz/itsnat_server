    <p>"Disconnected Nodes" is a powerful feature to save server memory alongside node caching provided
        by templates. The idea is simple, remove all of child nodes of the selected parent node with no action performed in client
        (only elements are supported as parents). 
        By this way, the parent node does not contain child nodes but the client part remains 
        untouched saving memory in server. 
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, the client nodes below the parent node can be freely modified (including removing 
        and insertion) by user defined JavaScript code.  
    </p>

    <p>Reconnection is possible, when reconnecting the client DOM subtree is cleared and now client
       and server and again in sync, when you add new child nodes the same nodes will be added in client.
