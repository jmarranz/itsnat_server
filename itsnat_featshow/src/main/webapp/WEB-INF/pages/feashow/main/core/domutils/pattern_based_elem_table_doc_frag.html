    <p>The <code>ElementTable</code> utility interface is a pattern based
        element table, unlike an <code>ElementTableFree</code> DOM row and cell elements of the table
        have the same tag and are created using a pattern approach.
        An <code>ElementTable</code> object is created calling
        an <code>ElementGroupManager.createElementTable</code> method and attached to a DOM
        element parent of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        The original markup of the subtree being associated to the <code>ElementTable</code>
        must contain one row item element and inside this row and almost a cell element,
        this row and the first cell will be the row and cell patterns and will be saved internally by the
        table and used to create new rows and cells.
    </p>
    <p>A Java data object can be rendered as markup inside a table using a
        <code>ElementTableRenderer</code> if provided (otherwise the default is used).
        The cell element provided to render the data object as markup is the element
        parent of the cell (this element is a direct child of the row element) but it can change using a user defined
        <code>ElementTableStructure</code>.
