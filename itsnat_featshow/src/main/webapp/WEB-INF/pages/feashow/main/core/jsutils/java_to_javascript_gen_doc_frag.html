<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example shows how to construct JavaScript code to access
        a DOM client element using the server element and the ItsNat internal path system,
        how to transport a Java string as a JavaScript string,
        how to set an element property and to call an element method.
    </p>
    <p>The utility class used is <code>ScriptUtil</code> obtained
        from the document calling <code>ItsNatDocument.getScriptUtil()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The JavaScript generated by methods like <code>ScriptUtil.getNodeReference</code>
        is not documented and may change.
    </p>
    <p>Note: this example does not work if the example tab is loaded directly
    for instance with this direct <a href="?itsnat_doc_name=feashow.main&feature=feashow.core.jsutils.javaToJavaScriptGen.ex">link</a>.
    This is not a bug, ItsNat is designed to control form controls from server (this example
    changes a text box using custom JavaScript), in page loading time form controls
    are forced to be in sync with the server. Changing form controls with custom JavaScript in load time losing the sync with the server
    is not a very good practice, anyway to avoid this problem you can use a load event instead of the document load handler.
