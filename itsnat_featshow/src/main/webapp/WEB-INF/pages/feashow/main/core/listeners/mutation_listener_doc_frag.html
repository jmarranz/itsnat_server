<div class="explanation">
    <p>In a normal ItsNat application the client DOM is updated automatically
    when the server DOM changes. If the client DOM changes ItsNat can update the
    server DOM accordingly, registering a mutation event listener calling
    <code>ItsNatDocument.addMutationEventListener</code>, when the client DOM changes
    a mutation event is sent to the server, this event is received and automatically changed the
    server DOM before dispatching to the listener (our example basically logs the changes).
    </p>

    <p>This feature only works with a browser with W3C mutation events (like FireFox, Opera or Safari),
    and uses <code>NodeMutationTransport</code> behind the scenes, a specialization
    of the class <code>ParamTransport</code>, used to transport the client mutation and to synchronize the server.
