    <p>The standard way to request an ItsNat based new page includes
        the target servlet (ItsNat based) and an <code>itsnat_doc_name</code>
        with the template used to build the new page.
        This URL is not "pretty", ItsNat does not provide an "out of the box"
        pretty URL pattern but it offers some support to build the preferred
        style.
    </p>
    <p>When a new page request is received by an ItsNat based servlet (not an event),
        ItsNat ever executes the global <code>ItsNatServletRequestListener</code> registered,
        calling <code>ItsNatServlet.addItsNatServletRequestListener</code>, if any.
        If the request does not include the <code>itsnat_doc_name</code> parameter (or attribute) there is no
        <code>ItsNatDocument</code> created. This global listener may detect this scenario
        and analyze the URL used (for instance a pretty URL) to build an <code>itsnat_doc_name</code>
        attribute to set to the request, and forward again the request and response
        objects to the ItsNat servlet. ItsNat looks for <code>itsnat_doc_name</code> first
        as an attribute if not found the as a request parameter.
