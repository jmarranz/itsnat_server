    <p>This example shows how XUL documents are first class ItsNat documents like
    X/HTML including AJAX events (SCRIPT based is also possible), Comet, fragments etc. Most of the features of ItsNat provided for X/HTML documents
    are valid for XUL too.
    </p>
    <p>Batik DOM does not recognize XUL specifically, any XUL document must be managed
    as a generic XML document (using DOM Core interfaces).
