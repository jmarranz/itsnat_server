    <p>This is the first way to use the built-in functional web testing
    of ItsNat. From the server we can fire W3C DOM events
    and dispatch them in the server with no browser interaction.
    </p>

    <p>In this case we do not need a new thread (started calling
    <code>ClientDocument.startEventDispatcherThread</code>, ItsNat detects that a normal
    thread is being used to dispatch events and then these events are dispatched
    directly to the server DOM.
