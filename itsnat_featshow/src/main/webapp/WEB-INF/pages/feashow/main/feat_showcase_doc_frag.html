    <h5>Overview</h5>

    <p>The ItsNat's Feature Showcase is a special Java AJAX (SCRIPT mode for events can also be used)
    web application using ItsNat to show its capabilities with many examples and the source code used.
    You are free to use the Feature Showcase's source code in your projects with no limitation
    including closed source derivatives.
    </p>

    <p>Feature Showcase's examples are very simple and oriented to show how to use the APIs, they are not
    shocking examples to impress you, ItsNat is not a picture is much like a painter's palette.
    The HTML used is very very simple because any piece of markup should be understood easily,
    HTML (and XML) templates and final output, to show <b>you have complete control of the layout</b>.
    We invite you to select output markup regions in every example using the
    marvelous Mozilla/FireFox's "View Selection Source" contextual menu option to see how the markup is finally rendered.
    </p>

    <p>
    Many examples are repetitive to show how the same
    code may be used to render different markup, tons of reusing can be done
    but is not because every example tries to be isolated.
    </p>

    <p>The Feature Showcase documentation is brief and does not substitute
        the <i>Reference Manual</i> and <i>JavaDoc</i>.
    </p>

    <h5>Feature Showcase Organization</h5>

    <p>This application is designed to show examples using the most important ItsNat features,
    the code used by every example is shown on line too. The Feature Showcase is itself a mini-framework
    and is not part of ItsNat itself, your own ItsNat application may be very different, for instance,
    every feature example inherits from <code>FeatureTreeNode</code>, this class is not part of ItsNat,
    except minor infrastructure code, the code showed is
    representative of the typical uses of ItsNat.
    </p>

    <p>The <i>HTML Example in Manual</i>, <i>XML Example in Manual</i>
    and <i>Component Based Example in Manual</i> are complete and autonomous ItsNat applications
    with no dependency with the Feature Showcase mini-framework.
    They are interesting to get a <i>complete picture</i> of an ItsNat application.
    </p>

    <p>The source code of every example is shown online using a
    JavaScript based <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/">Syntax Highlighter</a>.
    Syntax highlighting is a slow task running in your browser, be patient, is worth the wait.
