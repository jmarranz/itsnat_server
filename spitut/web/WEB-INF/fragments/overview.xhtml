        <p>This "fundamental" state is processed by crawlers of search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing...)</p>
        <p>To understant how this SPI web site is "seen" by search engines, disable
            JavaScript in your browser.
        </p>
        <p>You can load a new text like a pop-up window, the link
           used to open this pop-up contains a URL specifying as fundamental
           state this state with the popup already loaded, this URL is used
           by crawlers because "return false" is not executed.
           By this way text contained in pop-up is also processed by crawlers.
